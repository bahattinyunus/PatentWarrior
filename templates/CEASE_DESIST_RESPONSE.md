**To:** [Sender Name / Law Firm]
**Re:** Response to Allegation of Infringement regarding U.S. Patent No. [Patent Number]

Dear [Name],

We are in receipt of your letter dated [Date] alleging infringement of the above-referenced patent.

We take intellectual property rights seriously. However, your letter fails to provide sufficient specificity for us to evaluate your claims. To facilitate our review, please provide a detailed **Claim Chart** identifying:

1.  Each specific claim of the patent you allege is infringed.
2.  The specific product, feature, or code snippet in our system that you allege maps to each claim element.

Without this information, your allegations remain vague and unsubstantiated.

Furthermore, we are currently conducting a preliminary review of the prior art. Be advised that if we determine the patent to be invalid based on prior art (including [Reference specific known prior art if you have it]), we reserve the right to seek a declaratory judgment of invalidity and/or non-infringement, as well as attorney's fees under 35 U.S.C. § 285 for the assertion of a baseless claim.

We expect your detailed claim chart within 14 days. Until then, we deny all liability.

Sincerely,

[Your Name / Title]
**PatentWarrior Defense Unit**
